### 5. Add Features or Enhancements

To propose and implement a new feature:

- **Create an issue first** to discuss the feature idea
- **Wait for feedback** from the maintainers
- **Get approval** before starting development
- **Follow the development process** outlined below

## Development Process

### Getting Started

1. **Fork the repository** on GitHub
2. **Clone your fork** to your local machine:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/mcino-Introduction-to-Git-and-GitHub.git
   cd mcino-Introduction-to-Git-and-GitHub
   ```

3. **Create a new branch** for your work:
   ```bash
   git checkout -b feature/your-feature-name
   ```

4. **Make your changes** to the codebase

### Making Changes

- **Write clear code** with comments explaining complex logic
- **Follow bash best practices** and conventions
- **Test your changes** thoroughly before submitting
- **Keep changes focused** on a single feature or bug fix
- **Update the README** or documentation if needed
- **Add comments** to your code explaining the purpose and logic

### Testing Your Changes

Before submitting your pull request:

```bash
# Make the script executable
chmod +x simple-interest.sh

# Test the script with various inputs
./simple-interest.sh
```

Test cases to consider:
- Valid positive numbers
- Zero values
- Large numbers
- Decimal values (if applicable)
- Invalid inputs (non-numeric values)

### Committing Your Changes

- **Write clear commit messages** that describe what you changed and why
- **Use the present tense** ("Add feature" not "Added feature")
- **Reference issues** in your commits: `Fixes #123` or `Related to #456`
- **Keep commits atomic** (one logical change per commit)
- **Avoid mixing** multiple unrelated changes in one commit

Example commit message:
```
Add input validation for negative numbers

- Validate that principal, rate, and time period are positive
- Display error message for invalid inputs
- Fixes #42
```

### Submitting a Pull Request

1. **Push your branch** to your fork:
   ```bash
   git push origin feature/your-feature-name
   ```

2. **Create a pull request** on GitHub with:
   - A clear and descriptive title
   - A description of your changes
   - Reference to any related issues (e.g., "Fixes #123")
   - Screenshots or examples if applicable
   - Explanation of the changes and why they are needed

3. **Be responsive** to feedback and review comments

4. **Make requested changes** promptly

5. **Keep the conversation professional** and respectful
