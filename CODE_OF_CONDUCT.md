Community leaders have the right and responsibility to:

## Scope

This Code of Conduct applies within all community spaces, and also applies when an individual is officially representing the community in public spaces. Examples of representing our community include using an official project e-mail address, posting via an official social media account, acting as an appointed representative at an online or offline event, or otherwise acting in an official capacity.

Specifically, this Code of Conduct applies to:

- GitHub repositories and related online spaces
- Project documentation and wikis
- Community forums and discussion boards
- Chat channels and instant messaging platforms used by the project
- Emails and direct messages related to project participation
- In-person events organized by the project
- Virtual conferences and meetups
- Social media interactions when representing the project
- Any other interaction in the context of the project

This Code of Conduct also applies to conduct outside these spaces if:

- It has the potential to negatively impact community members
- It violates the principles outlined in this Code of Conduct
- It represents the project in a negative way

## Enforcement

Instances of abusive, harassing, or otherwise unacceptable behavior may be reported by contacting the project team at [INSERT CONTACT EMAIL]. All complaints will be reviewed and investigated promptly and fairly.

All community leaders are obligated to respect the privacy and security of the reporter of any incident.

The project team will respond to reports in a timely manner and will work to resolve issues in a fair and transparent way. We will communicate with both the reporter and the accused party about the findings and any actions taken.

## Enforcement Guidelines

Community leaders will follow these Community Impact Guidelines in determining the consequences for any action deemed in violation of this Code of Conduct:

### 1. Correction

**Community Impact:** Use of inappropriate language or other behavior deemed unprofessional or unwelcome in the community.

**Consequence:** A private, written warning from community leaders, providing clarity around the nature of the violation and an explanation of why the behavior was inappropriate. A public apology may be requested.

### 2. Warning

**Community Impact:** A violation through a single incident or series of actions.

**Consequence:** A warning with consequences for continued behavior. No interaction with the people involved, including unsolicited interaction with those enforcing the Code of Conduct, for a specified period of time. This includes avoiding interactions in community spaces as well as external channels like social media. Violating these terms may lead to a temporary or permanent ban.

### 3. Temporary Ban

**Community Impact:** A serious violation of community standards, including sustained inappropriate behavior.

**Consequence:** A temporary ban from any sort of interaction or public communication with the community for a specified period of time. No public or private interaction with the people involved, including unsolicited interaction with those enforcing the Code of Conduct, is allowed during this period. Violating these terms may lead to a permanent ban.

### 4. Permanent Ban

**Community Impact:** Demonstrating a pattern of violation of community standards, including sustained inappropriate behavior, harassment of an individual, or aggression toward or disparagement of classes of individuals.

**Consequence:** A permanent ban from any sort of public interaction within the project community.
